# EDA on Country data

<h3> Introduction: </h3>
The social differences and evolution globally are hence socioeconomic and health-related factors that form the fundamental social base of all societies and countries. One of them is the Kaggle Country Dataset, which offers a comprehensive view of how demographic, health and economic variables intersect or depend on one another and affect the quality of life of people in multiple countries. To this end, this research examines these relationships by presenting statistical information or learnable returns to aid the decision-making process.
