# EDA on Country data

<h3> Introduction: </h3>
The social differences and evolution globally are hence socioeconomic and health-related factors that form the fundamental social base of all societies and countries. One of them is the Kaggle Country Dataset, which offers a comprehensive view of how demographic, health and economic variables intersect or depend on one another and affect the quality of life of people in multiple countries. To this end, this research examines these relationships by presenting statistical information or learnable returns to aid the decision-making process.

- country: Name of the country.
  child_mort: Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births.
- exports: Exports of goods and services per capita. Given as a percentage of the GDP per capita.
- health: Total health spending per capita. Given as a percentage of GDP per capita.
- imports: Imports of goods and services per capita. Given as a percentage of the GDP per capita.
- income: Net income per person.

- life_expec: The average number of years a new born child would live if the current mortality patterns are to remain the same.
- total_fer: The number of children that would be born to each woman if the current age-fertility rates remain the same.
- gdpp: The GDP per capita. Calculated as the Total GDP divided by the total population.
